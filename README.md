Install
======

Windows
------
First install python 3 :  
32 bit : http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.3.2/python-3.3.2.msi  
or 64 bit : http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.3.2/python-3.3.2.amd64.msi

Then install pyqt :  
32 bit : http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/files/PyQt4/PyQt-4.10.3/PyQt4-4.10.3-gpl-Py3.3-Qt4.8.5-x32.exe  
or 64 bit : http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/files/PyQt4/PyQt-4.10.3/PyQt4-4.10.3-gpl-Py3.3-Qt4.8.5-x64.exe

Then download the program.  
Extract the zip and run pixeditor.py


Linux
----
Just search Pyqt4 (python3-pyqt4) on the package manager, and install the version for python 3  
Then download the program.  
Make pixeditor.py executable and run it.


MacOS
----
It should work by installing python 3 an pyqt but apparently it didn't.  
Help is welcome.
